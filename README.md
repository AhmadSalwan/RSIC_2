# AI-Based Recruitment System for CPNS & PPPK

### Overview
This project is aimed at improving the recruitment process for Calon Pegawai Negeri Sipil (CPNS) and Pegawai Pemerintah dengan Perjanjian Kerja (PPPK) in government institutions. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), the system automates the selection process, ensuring faster, more accurate, and more efficient candidate screening and matching. The system integrates with government recruitment platforms like SSCASN, handles large data volumes, and prioritizes security and scalability.

### Key Features

* *Automated Screening:* Uses AI algorithms to match candidate qualifications (education, experience, certifications) with job descriptions.
* *Natural Language Processing (NLP):* Analyzes CVs and cover letters automatically to assess relevance to the job.
* *Test Scoring:* Integrates with government exam platforms (e.g., CAT for CPNS), automatically inputs and evaluates test results.
* *Position Matching:* Employs machine learning to predict candidate compatibility with available positions based on previous recruitment data.
* *Candidate Recommendations:* Provides HR and recruitment committees with recommendations for candidates best suited for interviews or further stages.


### Objectives

* *Increase Efficiency:* Automate and streamline the selection process to reduce administrative workload.
* *Reduce Bias:* Ensure transparency and objectivity in selection through AI-driven decisions based on qualifications and test results.
* *Optimize Resources:* Focus resources on the most suitable candidates, ensuring only the best are prioritized for final stages.
* *Improve Accuracy:* Provide a more precise matching system to align candidate skills and experience with job requirements.
